# Apache Web Serve #

## What is Apache:- ##
Apache HTTP Server is a free and open-source web server that delivers web content through the internet. It quickly became the most popular HTTP client on the web. PHP is the programming language that works with Apache to help create dynamic web content.

## why use Apache Server:- ##
Apache is considered open-source software, which means the source code is freely available for viewing and collaboration. Being open-source has made Apache very popular with developers who have built and configured their modules to apply specific functionality and improve its core features.
Apache web servers are used by over 67% of all web servers in the World.
 Apache web servers are easy to customize an environment, fast, reliable, and highly secure. It makes Apache web servers a common choice by most companies.

## Features of Apache Web Server:- ##
    • Handling of static files
    • Loadable dynamic modules
    • Auto-indexing
    • .htaccess
    • Compatible with IPv6
    • Supports HTTP/2
    • FTP connections
    • Gzip compression and decompression
    • Bandwidth throttling
    • Perl, PHP, Lua scripts
    • Load balancing
    • Session tracking
    • URL rewriting
    • Geolocation based on IP address

## apache server work:- ##
Apache functions communicate over networks from client to server using the TCP/IP protocol. HTTP/S or HyperText Transfer Protocol is one of the main protocols on the web. The Apache server is configured via config files in which modules are to control its behavior. By default, Apache listens to the IP addresses configured in its config files that are requested. Apache can accept and route-specific traffic to certain ports and domains based on specific address-port combination requests.

Once a message reaches its destination or recipient, it sends a notice or ACK message to the original sender that their data has successfully arrived. If there's an error in receiving data or some packets were lost in transit, the destination host or client sends a Not Acknowledged, or NAK message, to inform the sender that the data needs to be retransmitted.


## conclusion:- ##
Apache has proven to be a staple in many popular stacks and the backbone of the early internet year. While its popularity is declining and web server choices are increasing, Apache still plays a pivotal role in many technology stacks and the company infrastructure. Even with new technologies and servers coming out nonstop, Apache is still a technology every developer should learn to handle and configure.

# Snowflake #

## what is a Snowflake:- ##
Snowflake is a cloud data warehouse that brings simplicity without sacrificing features. It is a fully managed SaaS (software as a service) that provides a single platform for data warehousing, data engineering, data science, data application development, and secure sharing and consumption of real-time shared data. Snowflake features are like separation of storage and compute, data sharing, data cloning, and third-party tools support to handle the demanding needs of growing enterprises.

## history of Snowflake:- ##
Snowflake Inc. was founded in July 2012 in San Mateo, California, by three data warehousing experts Benoit Dageville, Thierry Cruanes, and Marcin Żukowski. Dageville and Cruanes previously worked as data architects at Oracle Corporation; Żukowski was a co-founder of the Dutch start-up Vectorwise. The company's first CEO was Mike Speiser, a venture capitalist at Sutter Hill Ventures.

## Three main components are:- ##
    1. ### _Cloud Services_ ###-Snowflake uses ANSI SQL for cloud services empowering users to optimize their data and manage their infrastructure. Snowflake handles the security and encryption of stored data.
    2. ### _Query processing _###-Query execution performed in the processing layer. Snowflake processes query using the virtual warehouse. Each virtual warehouse is an independent compute cluster that does not share resources with other virtual warehouses.
    3. ### _Database storage_ ###- When data is loaded into Snowflake, Snowflake reorganizes that data into its internal optimized, compressed, columnar format. Snowflake stores this optimized data in cloud storage.


## benefits of using Snowflake:- ##
    1. ### _Instant, nearly unlimited scalability_### - Snowflake architecture uses a single elastic performance engine that delivers high speed and scalability. Snowflake supports as many concurrent users and workloads as you can throw at it, from interactive to batch. Its high-performing and robust, giving enterprises the confidence they need that they will be able to handle every data workload.
    2. ### _Automation made easy _### - Snowflake enables enterprises to automate data management, security, governance, availability, and data resiliency. That drives scalability, optimizes costs, reduces downtime, and helps improve operational efficiency. It is built for high reliability and availability, and it automates data replication for fast recovery.
    3. ### _Third-party data integrations_ ### - The Snowflake Data Marketplace offers third-party data and connects with Snowflake customers to extend workflows with data services and third-party applications.
